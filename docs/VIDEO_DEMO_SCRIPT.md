**Visual**: Workflow logs showing agentic mode
- Expand "Run PatchPro analyze-pr" step
- Scroll to show key log lines

**Voiceover**:
> "Notice here: Agentic mode is enabled. PatchPro isn't just generating patches - it's using AgenticPatchGeneratorV2, which means it validates every patch and retries if something fails."

**On-Screen Text** (highlight in logs):
```
üîß Agentic mode: True
ü§ñ Using AgenticPatchGeneratorV2 for agentic generation with self-correction
```

**Actions**:

**Voiceover**:
> "But here's the proof that self-correction actually works. See these trace files? Look at the filenames carefully. F841, example.py, line 9, attempt 1. And here's the same finding, attempt 3. That's not a duplicate - that's PatchPro retrying after the first attempt failed. The system learned from its mistake and tried again. Automatically."

**On-Screen Text** (annotate the logs):
```
Same finding, different attempts = Self-correction! üéØ

F841_example.py_9_1_*.json    ‚Üê Attempt 1 (first try)
F841_example.py_9_3_*.json    ‚Üê Attempt 3 (retry after failure!)
```

**Visual Annotations**:
- Draw boxes around the two trace files
- Use arrows to connect them
- Label: "SAME FINDING" ‚Üí "RETRY AFTER FAILURE"

**Actions**:
1. Scroll to "Debug - List .patchpro contents" step
2. Click to expand it
3. Slowly scroll through trace files list
4. **STOP** at F841_example.py_9_1 file
5. Highlight it (use screen annotation tool)
6. Scroll to F841_example.py_9_3 file

### **SCENE 5: Show Telemetry Database (1:20 - 1:40)** ‚è±Ô∏è 20 seconds

**Visual**: Continue in debug logs, show traces.db

**Voiceover**:
> "All of this is stored in a SQLite database - traces dot db. Every LLM call, every validation result, every retry attempt. That means we can measure quality, identify failure patterns, and continuously improve. No other code fixing tool does this."

**On-Screen Text**:
```
üìä Telemetry captures everything:
  ‚Ä¢ LLM prompts & responses
  ‚Ä¢ Token usage & costs
  ‚Ä¢ Validation results
  ‚Ä¢ Retry attempts
  ‚Ä¢ Timestamps
```

**Actions**:
1. Scroll to show "traces.db" in the file list
2. Highlight it
3. Show the JSON files count (9+ files)
4. Pan/zoom to show full directory structure

**Timing Checkpoint**: Should be at 1:40

### **SCENE 6: Close with Impact (1:40 - 2:00)** ‚è±Ô∏è 20 seconds

**Visual**: Cut to GitHub PR #9 "Files changed" tab
- Show the diff with 827 findings detected

**Voiceover**:
> "PatchPro doesn't just fix code - it learns and gets better over time. This is the future of AI-assisted development. And it's ready to deploy today."

**On-Screen Text** (final slide overlay):
```
‚úÖ 827 findings processed in 3 minutes
‚úÖ Agentic self-correction verified (retry attempts visible)
‚úÖ Full telemetry for continuous improvement
‚úÖ Production-ready CI/CD integration

üöÄ PatchPro: The Code Quality Bot That Learns
```

**Actions**:
1. Navigate back to PR #9 main page
2. Show "Files changed" tab
3. Briefly scroll through the changed files
4. Cut to final title card with key metrics
5. Hold for 3 seconds
