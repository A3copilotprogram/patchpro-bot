- ✅ Your original analyzer.py (preserved)
- ✅ agent_core.py from agent-dev

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub (Recommended)

```bash
# Push your updated feature/analyzer-rules branch
git push origin feature/analyzer-rules --force-with-lease

# Or if you want to be extra careful:
git push origin feature/analyzer-rules
```

**Note**: Using `--force-with-lease` is safe because you're ahead of origin. It just updates your remote branch.

### 2. Update patchpro-demo-repo Workflow

Now you can update the demo repo to use `feature/analyzer-rules`:

```yaml
# In patchpro-demo-repo/.github/workflows/patchpro.yml
- name: Checkout patchpro-bot
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    repository: denis-mutuma/patchpro-bot
    ref: feature/analyzer-rules  # ✅ Use this branch
```

### 3. Clean Up (Optional)

You can delete `feature/integrated-agent` since it's identical:

```bash
# Delete local branch (optional)
git branch -d feature/integrated-agent

# If you pushed it, delete remote too:
git push origin --delete feature/integrated-agent
```

---

## 🔍 Verification

### Check Everything Works:

```bash
# 1. Verify branch status
git branch -v

# 2. Test imports
python3 -c "from patchpro_bot import AgentCore; print('OK')"

# 3. Test CLI
patchpro --help

# 4. Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```
